## Express Overview

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is designed to be simple yet powerful, allowing developers to build web servers and APIs efficiently. Express is particularly well-suited for creating RESTful APIs due to its lightweight structure and middleware capabilities.

## Why Express?

We chose Express for the DigiStokvel system to handle communication with the Interledger Protocol (ILP) Open Payments API. Express provides a straightforward way to build RESTful services, enabling us to manage complex payment interactions such as creating grants, handling incoming and outgoing payments, and generating quotes. Its asynchronous nature and middleware support make it ideal for integrating with external APIs, allowing us to streamline the payment processes and enhance the financial aspects of DigiStokvel.

## Core Features

The DigiStokvel Express app provides several key features:

- **Grant Management**: Facilitates the creation of grants to authorize access to different parts of the payment system.
- **Incoming and Outgoing Payments**: Manages payments to and from users, enabling seamless transactions between participants.
- **Quotes Generation**: Supports the creation of quotes to estimate costs for specific payment operations, helping users understand transaction fees before proceeding.
- **Integration with ILP Open Payments**: Provides a seamless interface to communicate with the ILP Open Payments API, ensuring secure and efficient payment handling.
