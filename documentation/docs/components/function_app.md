## Function Apps Overview

In the DigiStokvel system, function apps play a critical role in automating the financial operations, specifically managing payouts and contributions. These function apps are scheduled to run daily, ensuring that all scheduled payments are processed on time without manual intervention. By using function apps, we achieve a high level of efficiency and reliability in managing the flow of funds within each stokvel.

## Purpose of Function Apps

The function apps are designed to handle the core financial operations of DigiStokvel, focusing on two main engines:

**Payouts Engine**:

   - Responsible for executing scheduled payouts to stokvel members. This ensures that members receive their payments automatically based on the agreed payout schedules without requiring administrators to manually initiate the process.
   - The function app checks the payout schedule daily and processes any payments that are due. It retrieves the relevant details (such as the amount and recipient information) and initiates the transfer, ensuring timely and accurate disbursement of funds.

**Contributions Engine**:

   - Manages the recurring contributions from stokvel members. Members’ contributions are essential for maintaining the financial health of the stokvel, and the contributions engine ensures that these payments are processed smoothly.
   - The function app runs daily to check if any members are due to make a contribution on that day. If there are scheduled contributions, the app initiates the payment process, debiting the members' accounts and crediting the stokvel's funds.

## How Function Apps Work

**Daily Schedule**:

   - The function apps are scheduled to run automatically every day. This setup ensures that the system does not miss any scheduled payouts or contributions, maintaining consistency and trust among stokvel members.
   - Each day, the function apps check the database for any scheduled payments and determine if a payout or contribution needs to be processed.

**Automated Payment Processing**:

   - When a payment (either payout or contribution) is due, the function app retrieves the necessary details, such as the amount, recipient, and payment method.
   - The app then initiates the payment through the DigiStokvel system’s integrated payment processing service, ensuring that funds are transferred securely and efficiently.
   - After the payment is processed, the app updates the database to reflect the transaction, marking it as completed and sending any necessary notifications to the stakeholders.

**Error Handling and Notifications**:

   - The function apps are equipped with error handling mechanisms to manage any issues that may arise during payment processing (e.g., insufficient funds, network failures).
   - If an error occurs, the app logs the issue and attempts to retry the payment if possible. Additionally, administrators are notified so they can take any necessary actions to resolve the issue.

## Benefits of Using Function Apps

- **Automation**: By automating the process of managing payouts and contributions, function apps reduce the need for manual intervention, saving time and reducing the risk of errors.
- **Scalability**: Function apps can handle a high volume of payments, making them suitable for stokvels of all sizes. As the number of members grows, the system can scale to accommodate the increased demand without significant changes to the infrastructure.
- **Reliability**: Running the function apps on a daily schedule ensures that no scheduled payment is missed, maintaining the trust and consistency that are essential in a financial platform like DigiStokvel.
- **Efficiency**: Automated processing ensures that all payments are handled quickly and accurately, allowing stokvel administrators to focus on other important tasks rather than manually managing payouts and contributions.

## Technical Details

The function apps are deployed on a cloud-based platform, ensuring high availability and reliability. They are configured to run daily using cron schedules, and each function is designed to be lightweight and efficient, focusing solely on its core task of processing payments.

By leveraging these function apps, DigiStokvel ensures that its financial operations run smoothly, providing users with a seamless and automated experience. This setup allows stokvel members and administrators to have confidence in the system, knowing that their payouts and contributions are managed accurately and on schedule.
