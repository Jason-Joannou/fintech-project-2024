## Flask Overview

Flask is a lightweight, micro web framework for Python that is easy to set up and use. It allows developers to create web applications quickly and efficiently by providing essential tools and flexibility. Flask is particularly well-suited for projects where simplicity and modularity are important.

## Why Flask?

We chose Flask for the DigiStokvel system because of its lightweight architecture, ease of use, and flexibility. Flask allows us to build a scalable backend that can easily handle our needs, including handling API requests, managing data, and integrating with other services like WhatsApp and mobile money solutions.\

## Core Features

The DigiStokvel Flask backend provides several key features:

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Securely manage user registration, login, and authentication.
- **Stokvel Management**: Create, join, and manage stokvel groups.
- **Automated Contributions and Payouts**: Schedule and automate contributions and payouts.
- **Integration with WhatsApp**: Interact with the system through a WhatsApp chatbot for ease of use.
