## Testing Overview

Our project places a strong emphasis on ensuring code quality, functionality, and reliability through comprehensive testing. We have developed an extensive test suite that covers various aspects of the application, including unit tests, integration tests, and API endpoint tests. These tests are crucial for validating the correctness of our analytical functions, ensuring seamless interaction with external APIs, and confirming that the core features of our application are functioning as expected.

Our test suite is executed automatically as part of our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline implemented in GitHub Actions. This setup allows us to catch potential issues early in the development process, maintain high code quality standards, and deliver a robust application to our users.

### CI Pipeline

All commits and pull requests are automatically validated through our [CI pipeline](../devops/github.md#ci-pipeline), which runs the entire test suite. Any failures trigger immediate notifications, ensuring that issues are addressed promptly. This automated process helps us maintain consistency and reliability throughout the development lifecycle.
