# Welcome to the DigiStokvel Documentation

## Project Overview

### Business Context

A stokvel is a traditional savings scheme practiced in South Africa, where a group of people agrees to contribute a fixed amount of money to a common pool on a regular basis. This pool is then used for a common objective, such as savings, investments, or purchasing goods. The stokvel sector in South Africa is substantial, with over 810,000 active stokvels comprising 11 million members and managing around R50 billion annually.
The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a platform that digitizes stokvels using the Interledger Protocol (ILP) Open Payments standard. The platform aims to enhance financial inclusion by being accessible through a low-tech interface, specifically a WhatsApp chatbot. This approach ensures that even users with basic mobile phones can participate in the digital economy.

### Problems and Opportunities

**Problems**:

- Traditional stokvels often rely on physical meetings and manual record-keeping, making the process time-consuming and prone to errors.
- Limited access to formal banking services for many stokvel members, which restricts their ability to participate in digital financial services.
- High transaction costs associated with traditional banking solutions can be a barrier for low-income individuals.

**Opportunities**:

- Leveraging WhatsApp, a widely used communication tool in South Africa, provides a low-cost and familiar interface for users.
- Using the ILP Open Payments standard allows for interoperability across different financial systems, facilitating easier transfers between users and other financial services.
- A digital platform can improve transparency, security, and ease of managing contributions and payouts in stokvels, enhancing trust among members.

### Vision

The vision of the DigiStokvel project is to transform traditional stokvels into a digitally inclusive financial platform, making it easier for South Africans to save, invest, and build community wealth using familiar, low-cost tools like WhatsApp. By providing an accessible interface, DigiStokvel aims to bridge the gap between informal saving groups and the formal digital economy.

### Why is the project important

This project addresses a critical need for financial inclusion in South Africa, where many people lack access to formal banking services but have mobile connectivity. By digitizing stokvels, the project aims to:

- Reduce reliance on cash transactions, increasing security for stokvel participants.
- Make financial management more efficient and transparent.
- Provide a platform for members to access additional financial services, such as loans or insurance, through integrations with digital wallets.
- Empower communities to participate in the digital economy, supporting economic resilience and growth.
