## Database Design

### Introduction

In this project, we used a SQLite implementation to build and manage our database. The design focused on scalability and flexibility, ensuring efficient data handling for stokvel members, transactions, contributions, and payouts.

### Design Overview

While foreign key relationships were created between various tables to maintain logical data structures and relationships, we did not enforce these relationships in SQLite. This represents a shortfall in our current design, and adding foreign key enforcement will be considered as future work to ensure referential integrity within the system.

### Foreign Key Relationships
Although foreign key relationships were established in the table design, they were not enforced at the database level. In future iterations of this project, implementing foreign key enforcement will be critical to prevent orphaned records and ensure that relationships between entities (such as USERS, STOKVELS, and TRANSACTIONS) are properly maintained. This will enhance the integrity and reliability of the data as the system evolves.

### Tables and Relationships

The  various tables used in our design, the purpose of each table and the key fields of each table is detailed below
