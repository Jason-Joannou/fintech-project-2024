## Database Design

### Introduction

This project utilizes a SQLite database to build and manage data storage, focusing on scalability and flexibility. The design ensures efficient data handling for stokvel members, transactions, contributions, and payouts.

### Design Overview

While foreign key relationships were defined between various tables to maintain logical data structures, these relationships are not currently enforced by SQLite. This is a limitation of the existing design, and future updates will aim to implement foreign key enforcement to ensure referential integrity across the system.

### Foreign Key Relationships

Although foreign key relationships were set up in the table design, they are not enforced at the database level. Enforcing these relationships in future iterations will be essential to prevent orphaned records and to maintain the integrity of relationships between entities (e.g., **USERS**, **STOKVELS**, **TRANSACTIONS**). This step will enhance the data reliability as the system continues to develop.

### Tables and Relationships
