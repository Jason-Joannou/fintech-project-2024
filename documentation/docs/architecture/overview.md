## Architecture Overview

Our project is designed as a full-stack application, integrating a database, backend API, and frontend interface to deliver a comprehensive solution. The architecture is built to efficiently handle data processing, API requests, and user interactions, while leveraging Azure's cloud services to manage and scale our resources.

### Key Components

**Database**  

  The database serves as the foundation of our data management, storing and organizing the information needed by both the API and the frontend. We utilize a SQL-based relational database hosted on Azure, ensuring robust performance, security, and scalability.

**Backend API** 

  The API acts as the intermediary between the database and the frontend. It is built using FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. The API handles data processing, business logic, and communication with the database, providing endpoints for data retrieval, updates, and analytical functions. The API is containerized and deployed on Azure Container Instances for easy scaling and management.

**Frontend**  

  The frontend is the user-facing part of the application, developed using Vue.js. It provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the data, visualize results, and perform various operations. The frontend communicates with the backend API to fetch and display data in real-time, ensuring a seamless user experience.

**Azure Integration**  

  Azure is central to our infrastructure management, providing services for hosting, scaling, and monitoring our application. We use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) to define and manage resources, including our database, container registry, and container instances. Terraform is employed to define our infrastructure as code (IaC), enabling consistent and repeatable deployments.

This architecture ensures a modular, scalable, and maintainable system that can handle the demands of a dynamic and data-intensive application. By utilizing Azure's cloud capabilities, we are able to efficiently manage our resources, ensuring high availability and performance.
